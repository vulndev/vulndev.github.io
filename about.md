## About me
I work for an industrial company as some kind of security engineer in the field of incident detection & response.

## About this page
The main focus of this website is to be a reminder for myself and some kind of documentation for my projects, because Iâ€™m getting too old to remember everything.

Some of you may find the articles interesting.

The things written and loaded here are my own, they are not influenced or controlled by any company.
