## Who am I?
My name is Simon Krenz and I live in germany.

## Where do I work?
I work for an industrial company as some kind of security engineer in the field of incident detection & response. I also lead a team of talented red and blue teamers.

## What is this website about?
The main focus of this website is to be a reminder for myself and some kind of documentation for my projects, because Iâ€™m getting too old to remember everything.

Some of you may find the articles interesting and useful for your own projects.

The things written and loaded here originate exclusively from my own pen and are in no form controlled by my enterprise or to be brought in connection with this.
